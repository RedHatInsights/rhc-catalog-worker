# Catalog Worker

The Catalog Worker runs under the aegis of Red Hat Connect (rhc). It can be run in a vm or container and talks to an on-prem Ansible Tower. It can
* Collect inventory objects from Ansible Tower
* Launch and monitor jobs on Ansible Tower.

The Red Hat Connect (rhc) subscribes to a specific topic on the Cloud Connector based on its
unique guid. When a task needs to be done on the client the Cloud Connector sends a small message
packet to the RHC which transfers the message to the Catalog Worker via GRPC. The message includes the url to get the task details, a date time stamp and the kind of task.
```json
{
    "url": "http://cloud.redhat.com/api/catalog-inventory/v3.0/tasks/xxxx",
    "kind": "catalog",
    "sent": "2020-10-03T12:34:56Z"
} 
```

Once the catalog worker gets this message it looks at the URL and fetches the task details.

The client updates the task after it has finished processing.
The client can either send the response directly to the task#result or it can upload a 
compress tar file to the upload service. Since the inventory data tends to be big we usually upload
that via a compressed tar file. For other simple requests we directly update the task#results.

A task is a collection of jobs alongwith result format and upload url.

e.g.
```json
{
    "response_format": "tar|json",
    "upload_url": "https://cloud.redhat.com/api/v1/ingress/upload"
    "jobs": [{
        "href_slug": "/api/v2/job_templates",
        "method": "get",
        "fetch_all_pages": true,
        "apply_filter": "results[].{id:id, inventory:inventory, type:type, url:url}"
        "fetch_related": [{
            "href_slug": "survey_spec",
            "predicate": "survey_enabled"
        }]
    }]
}
```
